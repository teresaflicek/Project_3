                Native American groups, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and
                the death of George Floyd. They then moved to and tried toppling the statue of Christopher Columbus, but
                were stopped by the police. The Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department later said the
                demonstration was 'hijacked by organized mobs' as people hid under black umbrellas and changed into
                black clothes, formed a wall and marched on officers, used sharpened PVC pipes to jab at officers, and
                threw fireworks, cans, frozen water bottles, and rocks at the police. Police struck people with batons
                and deployed tear gas and pepper spray. At least 5 demonstrators and 4 police officers were taken to the
                hospital. In total 18 officers were seriously injured. 12 people were arrested. Activists alleged that a
                Black teenager filming at the scene was punched in the mouth by the police and had her teeth knocked
                out. One reporter alleged to have been verbally and physically assaulted by the police, another claimed
                her phone was slapped out of her hand by a police officer with his baton. Police took 76 bikes from the
                scene. They claimed that the bikes were either abandoned or used as weapons against police.
                Demonstrators claimed that the bikes were taken from them, some by force and without any explanations.
